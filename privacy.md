## Privacy
A randomized ID is created and associated with each device that plays Man vs Fly. The ID is used to figure out how many people have played the game, and for how long. No personal, or identifying, information is collected.

You do have the option to submit a custom username to a global leaderboard within the game. The username may be visible to other players.

That's it. The game is supposed to be fun without forking over tons of personal data, like some other games.
